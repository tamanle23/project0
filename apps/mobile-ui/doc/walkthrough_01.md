# Walkthrough: React Native Scaffold (v1)

I have successfully scaffolded the React Native project with Expo SDK, React Navigation, and Zustand.

## Changes Made
- Created `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `app.json`, and `babel.config.js` with all necessary dependencies and Expo configurations.
- Scaffolded the application entry point in `App.tsx` utilizing a navigation container that handles dark and light mode dynamically.
- Defined shared TypeScript models in `src/types/index.ts`.
- Set up a lightweight, persistent state management solution using `zustand` with `AsyncStorage` (in `usePostStore.ts` and `useSettingsStore.ts`).
- Created the core Liquid Glass design primitives:
  - `<LiquidGlassView>`: Automatically falls back to standard background colors for low-end Androids and older iOS devices, or when users toggle "Reduce Transparency".
  - `<GlassCard>` and `<GlassButton>` built upon the glass view for consistent aesthetics.
- Configured a bottom tab navigation `RootNavigator` that renders as a floating glass pill container.
- Implemented three main screens:
  - **DashboardScreen**: Displays a feed of posts utilizing `<FlatList>`.
  - **CreatePostScreen**: Clean text inputs with auto-expand capabilities and a publish action.
  - **ProfileScreen**: Exposes settings to toggle theme variants and reduce transparency manually.

## Next Steps
You can navigate into the project and install dependencies:
```bash
cd c:\Users\Admin\workspace\git\project0\apps\mobile-ui
npm install
npx expo start
```
