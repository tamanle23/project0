# Architecture Refactoring - Frontend State & i18n Walkthrough

- **Liquid Glass Standards (Phase 4):** Created and exported `GlassButton` inside `@project0/ui` incorporating the translucent tokens.
- **State Decoupling (Phase 4):** Installed `zustand` and created `useUiStore` within `apps/console`. This pattern completely abstracts UI orchestration logic (e.g., modals) away from complex prop chains.
- **I18n Sync (Phase 4):** Consolidated common application strings into `packages/i18n/src/locales/` ensuring perfect parity between the `en` and `vi` JSON files as required by the monorepo architecture rules.
- **Validation:** Executed Turborepo builds for `@project0/console` to confirm types and Vite bundles resolve correctly with the new UI and state dependencies.
