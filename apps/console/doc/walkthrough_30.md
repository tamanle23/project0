# Walkthrough: Module Coupling Refactoring (Priority 2)

## Changes Made
- **Created `@project0/ui` Package**: Initialized a new internal workspace package at `packages/ui` to house shared UI utilities and icon assets.
- **Unified SVG Icons**: Extracted duplicated SVGs from `apps/console/src/assets/brand-icons` and `apps/tekgo-ui/components/social-icons` into `packages/ui/src/icons`. Both `console` and `tekgo-ui` now consume these icons from the shared package via `workspace:*`.
- **Extracted Tailwind Utilities**: Moved the `cn` utility (which combines `clsx` and `tailwind-merge`) from `console/src/lib/utils.ts` into `packages/ui/src/lib/utils.ts`. `apps/console` now re-exports this utility from the shared package, ensuring a single source of truth for standard UI functions.
- **Dependency Updates**: Updated `package.json` for both `apps/console` and `apps/tekgo-ui` to depend on `@project0/ui`, resolving the tight coupling issue where common UI logic was duplicated.

## Verification
- Verified the `packages/ui` package exports the correct icons and utilities.
- Re-ran the build pipeline (`turbo build`) for both `console` and `tekgo-ui` to guarantee successful compilation after the dependency link.
- Synced the Implementation Plan and Walkthrough to `apps/console/doc/` per tracking rules.
