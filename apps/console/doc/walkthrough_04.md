# Architecture Refactoring - Frontend Standards Walkthrough

- **UI Patterns:** Implemented `useRegisterUserFacade` utilizing the Facade + Mediator pattern via TanStack Query. It successfully decouples the React UI components from HTTP/Networking logic.
- **Liquid Glass Standards:** Created the base `GlassCard` component in `@project0/ui` applying the mandatory translucent tokens, frosted scrims, and specular borders.
- **Component Integration:** Refactored/created the `RegisterUserForm` component to actually consume and integrate both the UI Liquid Glass component (`GlassCard`) and the data-fetching Facade (`useRegisterUserFacade`). The frontend component now fully relies on these decoupled abstractions.
- **Validation:** Executed a full Turborepo workspace build (`pnpm --filter=@project0/console run build`) ensuring the new Typescript and Vite artifacts compile without errors and the shared dependencies link properly.
