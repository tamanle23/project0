# Architecture Refactoring - Phase 1 Walkthrough

## Summary of Changes
1. Generated `implementation_plan_14.md` which defines the exact architecture blueprint for a full-scale refactor of the `@unipost/backend`.
2. Established **Clean Architecture** combined with **CQRS** and **Mediator** as the required synergistic design patterns.
3. Outlined directory structures separating Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and Presentation layers.
4. Provided a concrete PoC implementation in Java demonstrating decoupled command handling and domain logic.
5. Explained how this design adheres to SOLID principles (specifically OCP via the Mediator dispatcher).

## Next Steps for Future Execution
This document serves as the guide for actual code migrations in subsequent phases. Developers or agents reading this blueprint can begin migrating existing Spring Controllers and Services into Command/Query Handlers and standardizing the Core Dispatchers in the `unipost-core` module.
