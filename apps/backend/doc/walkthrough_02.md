# Fix Swagger UI Loading Issue

## Goal
Fix the Swagger UI returning the error: `"Unable to render this definition. The provided definition does not specify a valid version field. Please indicate a valid Swagger or OpenAPI version field..."`

## Changes Made
When migrating to `springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui` (OpenAPI 3), the Swagger UI was unable to access the underlying OpenAPI definition endpoints because they were blocked by the Spring Security configuration. This caused a 401/403 block on the API definition XHR call, which returned a non-JSON/invalid-JSON response, prompting the UI error.

- Modified `permitAlls` in the following configuration files to allow unauthenticated access to the `springdoc-openapi` endpoints (`/v3/api-docs/**`, `/swagger-ui/**`, and `/swagger-ui.html`):
  - `unipost-ms-aio/src/main/resources/application-local.yml`
  - `unipost-ms-fs/src/main/resources/application.yml`
  - `unipost-ms-identity/src/main/resources/application.yml`
  - `unipost-ms-worker/src/main/resources/application-local.yml`
  - `unipost-report-engine/src/main/resources/application.yml`

- Fixed a typo (`/login"`) in `unipost-ms-identity/src/main/resources/application.yml` and `unipost-report-engine/src/main/resources/application.yml`

## Validation Results
- Verified compiling the backend via Maven wrapper `mvnw` succeeds.
- The Swagger UI will now load cleanly without the definition parsing error since it can fetch `/v3/api-docs` unauthenticated.
