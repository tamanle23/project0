# History Log 012: Enterprise Transformation Blueprint End-to-End Alignment

**Date:** 2026-10-09
**Task Title:** Update Enterprise Transformation Blueprint Document End-to-End

---

## Problem
The `docs/enterprise_transformation_blueprint.md` architectural blueprint required an end-to-end update and enhancement to accurately align with the actual current implementation state of the `@unipost` monorepo. Specifically, recent architectural innovations—including PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) isolation, `TenantContextHolder` lifecycle propagation, dual-layer composite cache keys (`schema:{tid}:{type}:v{tVer}_s{sVer}`), 3-tier Noisy Neighbor & ReDoS defenses, 5-stage GDPR Art. 17/20 pipelines, Domain Blueprint catalog provisioning, and WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility standards—were omitted or partially described in the previous draft.

---

## Plan
1. Audit `docs/enterprise_transformation_blueprint.md` against completed enterprise milestones in `docs/history/` (001–011) and `docs/multi-tenants/`.
2. Rewrite `docs/enterprise_transformation_blueprint.md` end-to-end across all 5 core sections:
   - **Section 1 (Design Strategy)**: Expand pillars to cover zero-trust boundaries, multi-tenant isolation, modulith boundaries, 3-tier resource protection, Liquid Glass / WCAG 2.2 AA standards, and Rule SOP governance.
   - **Section 2 (Architecture)**: Enhance target architecture ASCII diagram and document invariants (RLS session aspect, Facade/Mediator, ResolvableType dynamic dispatch, composite cache dual-keys, 50ms ReDoS regex execution timeout).
   - **Section 3 (Implementation Blueprint & Phase Roadmap)**: Re-structure roadmap into 9 distinct completed and evolving phases (Phases 1–8 completed, Phase 9 active/in-progress).
   - **Section 4 (Extensibility)**: Articulate Open/Closed Principle (OCP) extension points for Domain Blueprint manifests, Dynamic Widget Registry, and AI Agent MCP tools.
   - **Section 5 (Summary & Metrics)**: Define target enterprise quality KPIs for tenant isolation, schema resolution throughput, ReDoS defense abort timing, accessibility pass rates, and GDPR data portability.
3. Record history log `012` and update `docs/history/README.md`.

---

## Changes
- Updated `docs/enterprise_transformation_blueprint.md`:
  - Added 6 core design pillars.
  - Added multi-tenant backend gateway, RLS, rate limiting, and composite caching layer to the ASCII architecture diagram.
  - Expanded implementation roadmap into 9 comprehensive execution phases reflecting completed milestones.
  - Added OCP extension mechanisms for domain blueprints, UI widgets, and AI agent tools.
  - Defined enterprise quality KPIs.
- Created `docs/history/012_enterprise_transformation_blueprint_update.md`.
- Updated `docs/history/README.md` index table with entry `012`.

---

## Verification
- Verified `docs/enterprise_transformation_blueprint.md` file content via `read_file`.
- Verified formatting, Markdown hierarchy, ASCII diagrams, and technical consistency across all sections.

## Walkthrough
1. **Design Strategy**: Formulated 6 comprehensive pillars covering security, multi-tenancy, modulith architecture, resource protection, accessibility, and rule governance.
2. **Architecture**: Detailed the multi-layer system architecture and key technical invariants including `TenantSecurityAspect`, `ResolvableType`, `TimeoutCharSequence`, and composite dual-key caching.
3. **Phases 1–9**: Documented all 9 phases with clear statuses, objectives, and deliverables.
4. **Extensibility & KPIs**: Detailed OCP extension points and measurable target performance metrics.
