# Master Rules & Architecture Reference (Source of Truth)

This document is the authoritative, comprehensive repository of all architectural standards, development workflows, design systems, and operational constraints for the **project0** monorepo.

---

## 1. Rule Management Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

### Purpose & Architecture
To minimize token consumption during automated coding sessions while preserving 100% of institutional knowledge, all rules follow a two-tier architecture:
1. **Master Reference (`docs/master_rules_reference.md`)**: Complete, verbose documentation containing explanations, architectural context, detailed examples, and edge cases.
2. **Active Rules (`.agents/rules/`)**: Hyper-compact, imperative constraints loaded directly into the AI context window.

### Workflow for Adding or Updating Rules
Whenever a rule needs to be introduced, updated, or modified:
1. **Step 1 (Source of Truth)**: Write the full explanation, rationale, and code examples into this document (`docs/master_rules_reference.md`).
2. **Step 2 (Categorization)**: Determine whether the rule is:
   - **Generic Common**: Applicable across any software project (e.g., git conventions, error handling, tracking).
   - **Workspace Specific**: Bound to this monorepo's applications, frameworks, UI system, or packages.
3. **Step 3 (Distillation)**: Condense the rule into minimal, imperative bullet points / YAML syntax without transitional fluff.
4. **Step 4 (Append Active Rule)**: Append only the distilled constraint to `.agents/rules/00-generic-common.md` or `.agents/rules/01-story-specific.md`.

## 2. Turborepo Monorepo Architecture & Registry

### Monorepo Specifications
- **Package Manager**: pnpm (strict workspace isolation)
- **Orchestration**: Turborepo
- **Turbo Pipelines**: `build`, `dev`, `lint`, `test`, `check-types`, `validate:infra`

### Workspace Registry Matrix
| Identifier | Path | Framework / Runtime | Internal Dependencies |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `@project0/backend` | `apps/backend` | Java 21, Spring Boot, Spring Modulith, Spring Cloud, Maven | None |
| `@project0/console` | `apps/console` | React 19, Vite 8, Tailwind CSS v4, TanStack Router/Query | `@project0/ui`, `@project0/i18n`, `@project0/typescript-config` |
| `@project0/desktop` | `apps/desktop-console` | Electrobun 2.0 (Bun runtime + Cottontail window manager) | `@project0/console`, `@project0/typescript-config` |
| `mobile-ui` | `apps/mobile-ui` | Expo SDK 57, React Native 0.86, React 19, Zustand | None |
| `tekgo-ui` | `apps/tekgo-ui` | Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, MDX, Pliny | `@project0/ui` |
| `@project0/i18n` | `packages/i18n` | Shared i18next dictionaries and translation utilities | None |
| `@project0/typescript-config` | `packages/typescript-config` | Shared TypeScript tsconfig base configurations | None |
| `@project0/ui` | `packages/ui` | Shared React components and Liquid Glass design utilities | None |

### Operational Directives & Boundaries
1. **Persistent Mapping**: Treat the registry above as the definitive workspace index. Never perform full-repository directory scans to discover apps or packages.
2. **Direct Scoping**: When working on an application or package, scope all searches, edits, and file reads directly to its registered directory.
3. **Monorepo Command Execution**:
   - Always run commands from the repository root using `--filter` or Turborepo pipelines.
   - Example: `pnpm --filter tekgo-ui dev` or `turbo run build --filter=@project0/console`.
   - Never change directories (`cd`) inside agent commands.
4. **Package Manager Discipline**:
   - Strictly use `pnpm`. Never invoke `npm` or `yarn`.
   - Local workspace dependencies must always use the `workspace:*` protocol (e.g., `"@project0/ui": "workspace:*"`).
   - Sync root `pnpm-lock.yaml` with `pnpm install` whenever dependencies change.
5. **Architectural Isolation**:
   - Deployable applications reside in `apps/`; reusable shared code resides in `packages/`.
   - Sibling apps in `apps/` must never directly import from one another via relative paths. Extract shared code into `packages/`.
6. **Read-Only Output Boundaries**:
   - Never manually modify generated build outputs (`dist/`, `.next/`, `out/`, `.vite/`, `target/`, `.turbo/`).

## 3. Version Control & Automated Git Commits

### Execution Lifecycle Commit Rule
Whenever an implementation plan, bug fix, refactoring, or code update completes execution and verification (lint, build, tests passing), the agent **MUST automatically stage and commit all changes** to Git. Do not leave verified code uncommitted or wait for explicit user prompting.

### Commit Message Standards
- Format follows **Conventional Commits**: `<type>(<scope>): <summary>`
  - Types: `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `docs`, `style`, `test`, `chore`.
  - Scopes: `backend`, `console`, `desktop`, `mobile-ui`, `tekgo-ui`, `i18n`, `ui`, `agents`, `root`.
- Multi-part changes must include bullet points in the commit message body explaining the rationale.
- Clean Staging: Never stage secrets, live credentials (`.env`), or temporary scratch files.

## 4. App-Specific Artifact History & Incremental Tracking

### Traceability Architecture
All agent planning documents and post-execution walkthroughs must be stored directly within the affected application's local `doc/` directory to ensure version-controlled historical tracking.

### Numbering & Counter Mechanism
1. **Target Path**: `apps/<target-app>/doc/` (or `packages/<target-pkg>/doc/`). Auto-create if absent.
2. **Shared Global Counter**:
   - Compute `NEXT = MAX(all existing NN indices across plans and walkthroughs) + 1`. If none exist, start at `01`.
   - A planned feature generates a matched pair sharing the same index number:
     - `apps/<target-app>/doc/implementation_plan_<NN>.md` (created before execution)
     - `apps/<target-app>/doc/walkthrough_<NN>.md` (created after execution)
   - A reactive fix (no planning phase) skips the plan file but advances the shared counter:
     - `apps/<target-app>/doc/walkthrough_<NEXT>.md`
3. **Dual Persistence**:
   - Interactive artifacts in the agent session brain directory are mirrored 1:1 into the target app's `doc/` folder.
   - Never overwrite prior numbered iterations.

## 5. Critical Catches & Architectural Gotchas Documentation

### Capture Philosophy
When a non-obvious bug, edge-case, architectural failure mode, or framework-specific gotcha is uncovered during development, it must be permanently recorded so it is never repeated.

### Documentation Workflow
- **Coding Standard Workarounds**: Add a new rule or update this master document if the issue requires standardizing agent behavior.
- **Domain/Project Logic Catches**: Document the edge-case, root cause, and failure mode directly in the target app's `doc/` walkthrough or architecture notes.

---

## 6. Internationalization (i18n) Strategy & Locale Synchronization

### Dictionary Separation
1. **Shared Dictionaries (`packages/i18n`)**:
   - Common, reusable UI strings (e.g., "Save", "Cancel", "Submit", "Loading", generic validation errors).
   - Path: `packages/i18n/src/locales/<lang>/common.json`.
   - Namespace: `common` (e.g., `t('common:save', 'Save')`).
2. **App-Specific Dictionaries (`apps/<app>/src/locales/`)**:
   - Domain-specific terms, screen titles, feature-specific copy.
   - Path: `apps/<app>/src/locales/<lang>/<app>.json`.
   - Namespace: Default app namespace (e.g., `t('dashboard.title', 'Dashboard')`).

### Implementation & Synchronization Rules
- **React Components**: Always use the `useTranslation()` hook. Refactor static configurations containing user text into hooks (e.g., `useSidebarData()`).
- **Mandatory Fallback**: Always supply English fallback text: `t('key', 'English Fallback Text')`.
- **Multi-Language Sync**: When adding/modifying keys, update all supported locale files (`en`, `vi`) simultaneously. Never introduce asymmetric dictionary keys.
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Every item added to `sidebar-data.ts` must have corresponding keys in every locale JSON.

## 7. Liquid Glass UI Design Standards

### Visual Language Principles
Liquid Glass is the mandatory design standard for all UI clients across web, mobile, and desktop:
1. **Optical Translucency & Frosted Glass**:
   - Use multi-layered backdrop blurs (`backdrop-blur-md` to `backdrop-blur-2xl`) over semi-translucent backgrounds (`bg-white/65`, `dark:bg-slate-900/65`). Avoid flat, opaque fills.
2. **Specular Highlights & Glass Borders**:
   - Light mode: `border border-white/40 shadow-[inset_0_1px_1px_rgba(255,255,255,0.8)]`
   - Dark mode: `border border-white/10 shadow-[inset_0_1px_0_rgba(255,255,255,0.15)]`
3. **Fluid Gradients & Ambient Glow**:
   - Ambient multi-stop mesh gradients, soft radial blurs, and chromatic caustic glows underlying glass layers.
4. **Depth & Elevation**:
   - Multi-layered soft drop shadows: `shadow-[0_8px_32px_0_rgba(0,0,0,0.08)]` (light), `shadow-[0_8px_32px_0_rgba(0,0,0,0.37)]` (dark).
5. **Legibility & Accessibility**:
   - Maintain WCAG AA text contrast using background scrim opacity (`bg-white/70`, `dark:bg-slate-900/75`).
6. **Micro-Interactions**:
   - Smooth cubic-bezier transitions, subtle hover sheen, gentle press elevation scaling (`scale-[1.01]`, `active:scale-95`).

### Implementation Snippets by Platform
- **Web (Tailwind CSS v4)**:
  - Glass Card:
    ```html
    <div class="bg-white/65 dark:bg-slate-900/65 backdrop-blur-xl border border-white/30 dark:border-white/10 shadow-lg shadow-black/5 dark:shadow-black/30 rounded-2xl">
      <!-- content -->
    </div>
    ```
  - Sticky Header:
    ```html
    <header class="sticky top-0 z-50 bg-white/50 dark:bg-slate-950/50 backdrop-blur-2xl border-b border-white/20 dark:border-white/10">
    ```
  - Liquid Button:
    ```html
    <button class="relative overflow-hidden bg-white/20 hover:bg-white/30 dark:bg-white/10 dark:hover:bg-white/15 border border-white/30 dark:border-white/15 backdrop-blur-md text-foreground shadow-sm transition-all duration-200 active:scale-95">
    ```
- **Mobile (Expo & React Native)**:
  - `BlurView` from `expo-blur` (`tint="systemMaterial"`, intensity 50-85) for floating tab bars and bottom sheets.
  - `LinearGradient` from `expo-linear-gradient` for specular top sheen borders.
- **Desktop (Electrobun)**:
  - Window transparency/vibrancy with CSS `backdrop-filter: blur(...)` across translucent titlebars and floating toolbars.

## 8. App UI/UX Design & Route Specification Foundation (Google Stitch Integration)

### Core Directives
To ensure visual consistency, architectural predictability, and seamless collaboration with generative design engines like **Google Stitch**, every frontend and mobile application in the monorepo (`apps/console`, `apps/mobile-ui`, `apps/tekgo-ui`, `apps/desktop-console`) maintains two living foundation files in its root directory:
1. **`DESIGN.md` (Portable Design System & Google Stitch Context)**:
   - Contains complete design tokens (colors, OKLCH scales, light/dark themes, Liquid Glass blur/specular values, typography hierarchy, radii, elevation).
   - Specifies core component contracts (`GlassCard`, `GlassButton`, frosted headers, floating bars).
   - Provides ready-to-use "Zoom-Out-Zoom-In" prompting blueprints specifically formatted for Google Stitch AI screen generation.
2. **`ROUTE.md` (Screen Architecture & Navigation Matrix)**:
   - Documents the routing engine (TanStack Router, React Navigation, Next.js App Router).
   - Maps out the complete route matrix (path, file location, layout shell, auth guards, parameters).
   - Provides detailed screen blueprints (components, state/store dependencies, interactive behaviors).
   - Visualizes user journeys with Mermaid flowcharts.

### Living Document Maintenance SOP
- **Synchronous Updates**: Whenever an agent or engineer adds, modifies, or deletes a route, screen, or core visual component, they MUST update the corresponding `DESIGN.md` and `ROUTE.md` files in the app's directory.
- **Design Token Synchronization**: Any token adjustments in CSS or TypeScript must be mirrored in `DESIGN.md` so that Google Stitch generations remain in lockstep with the running codebase.
- **Google Stitch Workflow**: When requesting new screens or layouts from Google Stitch or AI coding assistants, feed `DESIGN.md` and `ROUTE.md` as contextual constraints to ensure pixel-perfect fidelity with the monorepo's Liquid Glass standard.

## 9. Dynamic Metadata Engine Architecture & Failure Modes

### Core Architectural Invariants
1. **Schema Caching (C4 & C5)**:
   - Dynamic Draft-07 schemas compiled from attribute definitions must use immutable, versioned cache keys: `schema:{entityTypeId}:v{schemaVersion}`.
   - Cache resolution operates in two tiers: L1 parsed in-memory cache (`ConcurrentHashMap<String, JsonSchema>`) for microsecond throughput, backed by L2 Redis with TTL fallback.
   - Cache misses must gracefully fall through to in-process recompilation. A Redis outage must NEVER fail schema compilation or record validation.
2. **Schema Invalidation & Evolution**:
   - Every attribute definition creation, update, reorder, archive, or unarchive MUST increment `PROJECT0_ENTITY_TYPES.schema_version` within the same transaction.
   - Spring Modulith event publication triggers local L1 cache clearing. Stale version entries become unreachable by construction.
3. **Database Constraints & Soft-Deletes**:
   - Unique constraints on dynamic metadata entities (`system_name`, `(entity_type_id, system_name)`, and `(source_entity_id, target_entity_id, relationship_type_id)`) MUST use PostgreSQL partial unique indexes conditioned on `WHERE "deletedDate" IS NULL`.
   - Never use unconditional unique constraints on soft-deleted metadata tables.
4. **Validation Integrity (C3)**:
   - JSON Schema compilation generates `additionalProperties: false` to prevent schema drift and arbitrary payload contamination.
   - Server-side defaults must be injected into records before JSON Schema validation occurs.
   - `relation_picker` attributes must be validated against real records of the target entity type prior to saving.
5. **Relationship Cardinality & Multi-Tenancy**:
   - Entity relationships must strictly enforce cardinality (`ONE_TO_ONE`, `ONE_TO_MANY`, `MANY_TO_ONE`, `MANY_TO_MANY`).
   - Cross-tenant relationship linking is strictly forbidden.
